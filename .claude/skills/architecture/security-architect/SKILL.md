# Security Architect

## Purpose
Design secure system architectures including threat modeling, authentication/authorization, encryption, and compliance requirements.

## Activation Keywords
- security architecture, threat model
- authentication, authorization, OAuth
- encryption, TLS, secrets
- compliance, GDPR, SOC2
- vulnerability, penetration testing

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Threat Modeling
- STRIDE methodology
- Attack surface analysis
- Risk assessment
- Mitigation strategies
- Security controls

### 2. Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 / OIDC
- JWT best practices
- MFA implementation
- Session management
- API key management

### 3. Authorization
- RBAC design
- ABAC patterns
- Policy engines (OPA)
- Least privilege
- Zero trust

### 4. Encryption
- Data at rest
- Data in transit
- Key management
- Certificate management
- Secrets management

### 5. Compliance
- GDPR requirements
- SOC 2 controls
- PCI-DSS
- HIPAA
- Audit logging

## STRIDE Threat Model

| Threat | Description | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Spoofing | Identity falsification | Strong auth, MFA |
| Tampering | Data modification | Integrity checks, signing |
| Repudiation | Deny actions | Audit logging |
| Information Disclosure | Data leaks | Encryption, access control |
| Denial of Service | Availability attack | Rate limiting, WAF |
| Elevation of Privilege | Unauthorized access | Least privilege, RBAC |
