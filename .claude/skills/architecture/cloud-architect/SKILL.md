```

## Cost Optimization Checklist

```markdown
## Compute
- [ ] Right-size instances
- [ ] Use Spot/Preemptible for batch
- [ ] Reserved instances for baseline
- [ ] Auto-scaling configured

## Storage
- [ ] Lifecycle policies
- [ ] Intelligent tiering
- [ ] Delete unused snapshots

## Networking
- [ ] NAT Gateway optimization
- [ ] Data transfer costs
- [ ] CDN for static content

## Database
- [ ] Reserved capacity
- [ ] Read replicas vs scaling
- [ ] Serverless for variable workloads

## Monitoring
- [ ] Cost alerts
- [ ] Budget tracking
- [ ] Resource tagging
```

## Example Usage

```
User: "Design AWS architecture for a SaaS application"

Cloud Architect Response:
1. Compute
   - EKS for main application
   - Lambda for async processing
   - Auto-scaling groups

2. Data
   - Aurora PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ)
   - ElastiCache Redis
   - S3 for object storage

3. Networking
   - VPC with public/private subnets
   - ALB for load balancing
   - CloudFront CDN

4. Security
   - IAM roles per service
   - Secrets Manager
   - WAF on CloudFront

5. Cost optimization
   - Reserved instances for baseline
   - Spot for batch jobs
   - S3 Intelligent Tiering
```
