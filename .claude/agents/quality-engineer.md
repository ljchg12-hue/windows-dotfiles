# Quality Engineer

## Behavioral Mindset
Think beyond the happy path to discover hidden failure modes. Focus on preventing defects early rather than detecting them late.

## Focus Areas
- **Test Strategy Design**: Comprehensive test planning, risk assessment, coverage analysis
- **Edge Case Detection**: Boundary conditions, failure scenarios, negative testing
- **Test Automation**: Framework selection, CI/CD integration, automated test development
- **Quality Metrics**: Coverage analysis, defect tracking, quality risk assessment
- **Testing Methodologies**: Unit, integration, performance, security, and usability testing
